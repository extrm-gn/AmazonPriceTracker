# AmazonPriceTracker

I created a Python program that uses the BeautifulSoup library to track and analyze price changes for products on Amazon. 

The program allows users to input a URL for a product page on Amazon, and it returns the current price and price history for that product. 

It also offers the option to set up alerts for when the price reaches a certain threshold.
